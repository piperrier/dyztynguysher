Host names
==========

For OAR, bwc.pl automatically recognizes the hostnames, thus there is no need
to supply hosts=...

Process launcher
================

OAR typically uses the oarsh wrapper as a connection means to run
processes on other nodes. bwc.pl should auto-detect OAR properly, and
tries its best to inform the underlying MPI implementation that oarsh
should be used. This is at least tested regularly on OpenMPI (see also
README.OpenMPI).
