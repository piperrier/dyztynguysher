Some explanations on the format of the renumbering table.


1. Format of the file
2. Given an ideal (p,r) on side s, how do I find its index in the table ?
3. Given an index in the table (and the polynomial pair), how do I find the
   corresponding ideal ?


0. Convention
=============

A rational ideal above p is represented by (p,r) with r greater than p.
A projective ideal above p is represented by (p,p).

1. Format of the file
=====================

The format of the file is described in filter/README.fileformat


2. Given an ideal (p,r) on side s, how do I find its index in the table ?
=========================================================================

* Compute vp
    vp = p + 1 if there is a rational side
    vp = 2*p + 1 if there are two algebraic sides

* Compute vr
    vr = r if there is a rational side and s corresponds to the algrebraic side
    vr = p + 1 if there is a rational side and s corresponds to the rational side
    vr = s*(p+1) + r if there are two algebraic sides

* Find the index j such that table[j] = vp and it is the beginning of a sequence
  of decreasing values
    In the renumbering table, all ideals above the same prime p belong to the
    same sequences of decreasing values, where the first one is vp

* Let i = j
  While table[i+1] >= vr and table[i+1] < table[j] do
    j++
  done

* The index of the ideal of (p,r) on side s in the renumbering table is i


This can be done with misc/renumber_convert with the following command line:

   echo "p r side" | ./misc/renumber_convert -renumber /path/to/renumber/file

Warning: p and r should be in hexa.


3. Given an index in the table (and the polynomial pair), how do I find the
   corresponding ideal ?
===========================================================================

* Let j = i
  While table[j-1] > table[j] do
    j--
  done

* Compute p
    p = index[j] - 1 if there is a rational side
    p = (index[j] - 1)/2 if there are two algebraic sides

* If i != j:
    if there is a rational side:
      r = index[i]
      s = algebraic side
    if there are two algebraic side:
      if index[i] <= p:
        r = index[i]
        side = 0
      else
        r = index[i] - (p+1)
        side = 1

* If i == j:
    if there is a rational side:
      if p > large prime bound on rational side:
        r = largest_root_mod_p (algebraic polynomial)
        side = algebraic side
      else
        r = p + 1 /* convention, does not really matter */
        side = rational side
    if there are two algebraic side:
      if polynomial on side 1 has a root modulo p
        r = largest_root_mod_p (side 1 polynomial)
        side = 1
      else
        r = largest_root_mod_p (side 0 polynomial)
        side = 0

This can be done with misc/renumber_convert with the following command line:

   echo "i" | ./misc/renumber_convert -renumber /path/to/renumberfile -poly /path/to/polyfile -inverse

Warning: i should be in hexa.
