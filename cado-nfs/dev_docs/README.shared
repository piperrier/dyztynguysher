Shared libraries in cado-nfs
----------------------------

cado-nfs uses dynamically linkable (shared) libraries for flexibility
within the linear algebra stage. Beyond that usage, this functionality
is a nuisance. In the particular case of cross-compiling for instance, it
might be preferrable to forcibly disable shared libraries in order to
avoid the annoyance of debugging the related issues. For this, the
following environment variables must be set:

CADO_NFS_STATIC=1
GF2X_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS="--disable-shared;and;also;whichever;flags;you;want;to;pass;to;gf2x;configure;separated;by;semicolons"
LDFLAGS=-static

(technically, all flags have different implications. But the no-brainer
is really to disable all).
