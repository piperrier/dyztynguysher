The polynomials in this directory are:

(a) either polynomials used to factor a given number (rsa155.poly, rsa704.poly,
    rsa768.poly). In that case some additional information might be provided
    (factor base bounds, ...)

(b) or reference polynomials used to tune CADO-NFS (c60.poly, c65.poly, ...)
    In that case those polynomials should be those found by CADO-NFS polynomial
    selection when run on the corresponding input 'n'.
